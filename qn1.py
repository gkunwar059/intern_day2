# 1. Write a Python function to find the Max of three numbers.

# def max_three(a,b,c):
#     if a >b and a>c:
#         print("a is greater")
#     elif b>a and b>c:
#         print("b is greater ")
#     # elif c >b and c >a:
#     else:
#         print("c is greater ")
    
    
# max_three(2,4,5)


def max_three(a,b,c):
    max_num=max(a,b,c)
    print(max_num)
max_three(4,6,7)
